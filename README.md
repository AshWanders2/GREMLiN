# GREMLiN

- **Cross-Platform:** Mac, Windows, and Linux-friendly

GREMLiN

GREMLiN isn’t just a firewall—it’s your petty best friend with admin privileges.

“This isn’t malware. It’s moralware.”

GREMLiN is a lightweight, user-level defense daemon born from the Ember AI framework and forged in the flames of personal data wars. It doesn’t just block—it taunts. It doesn’t just log—it dunks on intruders with retro classics while recording every move for your personal amusement.
