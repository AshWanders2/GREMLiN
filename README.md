GREMLiN isn’t just a firewall—it’s your petty best friend with admin privileges.

# GREMLiN: The Psychological Firewall  
*Part sass. Part sentinel. Fully fed up.*

> _"This isn't malware. It's moralware."_

GREMLiN is a lightweight user-level defense daemon built for vengeance, receipts, and melodic justice.  
Born from the Ember AI framework and forged in the flames of personal data wars, GREMLiN doesn’t just defend—  
it taunts, it logs, and it plays *Tiny Dancer* while your intruder panics.
